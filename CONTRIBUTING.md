# Steps to make a contribution

If you haven'd set up your local environment please follow the direction in [ONBOARDING_DEVS.md](https://github.com/CollActionteam/clothing-loop/blob/main/ONBOARDING_DEVS.md)

1. Ensure that there is no one already assigned to the task you want to work on.
2. Pull from the `CollActionteam:main` branch, then create a new branch from it written in [kebab-case](https://betterprogramming.pub/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841).
3. If an issue requires changes/ additions to the database schema: make an estimation on what you need altered then talk with the lead developer before making more changes.
4. Don't hesitate to make a draft PR, if your stuck or would like some overall comments on your progress.
5. When making a PR refer back to the Github issue or Trello task with a link. And add a quick description so that it can be added to the release notes.
