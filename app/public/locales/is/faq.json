    "content": "The Clothing Loop is an initiative that allows people to easily exchange clothes with others in their neighborhood. It's fun, free, and sustainable! The idea is simple: (large) bags full of clothes travel along a route with participants in a particular city or neighborhood. Have the bag taken home by the person in the Loop for you. And then it's time to shop! Take items you like and put something back that's in good condition but ready for a new owner. Share a photo of your latest find in the corresponding communication channel. Nice to see where your stuff ends up! Then you take the bag to the next person on the list."

Click on the bag when you received it and scroll down the list of names until you find your name. Also indicate the date you received the bag. This way we can make sure that we know where the bags are and if they are still well distributed along the route. An overview of the distribution of the bags you can see at the Route."

If you click on that name, you can find their address and contact details. Contact them and make an appointment about when to bring the bag. You can only see the details of the two participants before you and after you. Keep in mind that the route can always change due to the arrival of new participants. So always check the app before you pass the bag. This way we make sure that new participants are not missed and everyone is also meeting someone else. If you haven't received a response to your message from the person after two days, then feel free to contact the next list. So don't try to get this through the system. If someone doesn't respond to this, then give this to the host for a long time."

  "whatCanYouTakeFromTheBag": {
    "title": "What can you get out of the bag?",
    "content": "Feel free to take out the bag what you like and use. Don't be too modest! Experience teaches that it gets too full faster than it empties. So you don't have to put the same number of clothes in it when you're out of it. If you don't have any supplements, no problem, and be especially picky about what you put in the bag. Better a bag with a few pearls than a full bag of moderate quality. That only brings the level down! If you see clothes in the bag that you've already put in the bag, then you take care of them again. This way we make sure that clothes don't stay in the chain. And finally, if you see clothes in the bag that you think don't meet the chain, you don't wash them and bring this together, and then we can isolate them from the top of the bag and then we can do"

    "title": "What can't you put in the bag?",
    "content": "Put only whole, clean and unwashed clothes in the bag. Be really critical! A good gradometer is to think about whether you would like to put it in the bag yourself. Old shoes, socks, underwear and pants can't be in the bag anyway. If the bag is full, don't put any extra clothes in and wait for the next bag. Also look at the season: thicker wool sweaters in don colors don't want anyone to have in the summer. And you don't have to do everything in one go. It's nice to spread clothes over the bags. Ornaments can be made in a separate bag or box. And accessories can be added. Clothing bags (if they're so hot) or bags can't be made in your home (if they're so hot) or bags (if they're not in your home) can't be"
