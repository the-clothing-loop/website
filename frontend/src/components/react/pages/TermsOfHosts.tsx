      <h2>General rules of conduct</h2>
      <ol start={5}>
        <li>
          The Clothing Loop is an easy-to-access initiative as part of Stichting
          Slow Fashion Movement for swapping clothes with other people in your
          area or neighbourhood. The goal of The Clothing Loop is to make it
          easy and fun to share pre-loved clothes by connecting people in local
          communities that share a bag of clothes - free of charge. The Platform
          is solely intended to give Users the opportunity to participate in The
          Clothing Loop. After they have successfully registered, they will be
          connected to a Loop near their residence to actively start
          participating. Although participants and Hosts of a Loop are
          responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the concept of
          The Clothing Loop, and for all matters relating to the participation
          in a Loop and the conduct within a Loop, you as a Host have a key role
          in making sure the Loop runs smoothly – either independently, or
          together with one or more additional Hosts. We are happy to assist
          with tips and tricks, but we as Stichting Slow Fashion Movement have
          no responsibility and liability in respect hereto. We are only here to
          facilitate by providing the Platform, the rest is up to you and the
          participants!
        </li>
        <li>
          Your tasks and obligations as a Host include, among others, the
          following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              organizing the relevant Loop. This includes for example:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  sending each new participant a message as soon as possible
                  after the participant has registered, but in any case, within
                  4 weeks after registration to inform the participant about how
                  things are arranged within your specific Loop;
                </li>
                <li>
                  introducing the new participant to the other participants of
                  the Loop;
                </li>
                <li>
                  placing the new participant in a logical place in the route of
                  the Loop; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  being the point of contact for participants of the Loop in
                  case of questions, complaints or suggestions;
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              procure that participants abide by the general rules of conduct
              applicable to them as described in the Terms of Use and any rules
              agreed to by the participants of the Loop;
            </li>
            <li>
              issuing a warning to participants if they do not abide by the
              rules as referred to above;
            </li>
            <li>
              remove participants from the Loop if they no longer wish to
              participate or if they do not abide by the rules as referred to
              above;
            </li>
            <li>
              introducing and managing the bags that circulate within the Loop;

            <li>

              exchange them.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

      <h2>Use of other media and/or communication channels and applications</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Each Loop decides which channels or applications to use to communicate

          applications. The Host(s) and participants of a Loop are and remain
          responsible for all matters relating to the use of any chosen channel
          and/or application.

          negligence on our part.
        </li>
        <li>
          The foregoing also means that we are under no circumstances liable for
