                    addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 7 days in
                    advance, thereby giving the Controller sufficient time to be
                    able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of
                    the concerned sub-processor(s). The Processor shall provide

        and Super Admin). Furthermore, a delivering of an SSL certificate to
        encrypt traffic between the browser and the server.
