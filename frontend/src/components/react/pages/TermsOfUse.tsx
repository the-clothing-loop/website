                The goal of The Clothing Loop is to make it easy and fun to
                share pre-loved clothes by connecting people in local
                communities that share a bag of clothes - free of charge. The
                Platform, www.clothingloop.org, is solely intended to give Users
                the opportunity to participate in The Clothing Loop. After you
                have successfully registered, you will be connected to a local
                Loop near your residence to actively start participating. We
                note that the participants/users of a local Loop are responsible
                for the implementation and monitoring of the concept of The
                Clothing Loop – you and your community must do it together!
                Although The Clothing Loop is happy to assist with tips and
                tricks, it has no responsibility and liability in respect
