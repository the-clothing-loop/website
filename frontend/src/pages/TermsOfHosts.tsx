              rights therefrom.

          <h2>General rules of conduct</h2>
          <ol start={5}>
            <li>
              The Clothing Loop is an easy-to-access initiative as part of
              Stichting Slow Fashion Movement for swapping clothes with other
              people in your area or neighbourhood. The goal of The Clothing
              Loop is to make it easy and fun to share pre-loved clothes by
              connecting people in local communities that share a bag of clothes
              - free of charge. The Platform is solely intended to give Users
              the opportunity to participate in The Clothing Loop. After they
              have successfully registered, they will be connected to a Loop
              near their residence to actively start participating. Although
              participants and Hosts of a Loop are responsible for the
              implementation and monitoring of the concept of The Clothing Loop,
              and for all matters relating to the participation in a Loop and
              the conduct within a Loop, you as a Host have a key role in making
              sure the Loop runs smoothly – either independently, or together
              with one or more additional Hosts. We are happy to assist with
              tips and tricks, but we as Stichting Slow Fashion Movement have no
              responsibility and liability in respect hereto. We are only here
              to facilitate by providing the Platform, the rest is up to you and
              the participants!
            </li>
            <li>
              Your tasks and obligations as a Host include, among others, the
              following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  organizing the relevant Loop. This includes for example:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      sending each new participant a message as soon as possible
                      after the participant has registered, but in any case,
                      within 4 weeks after registration to inform the
                      participant about how things are arranged within your
                      specific Loop;
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      placing the new participant in a logical place in the
                      route of the Loop; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      being the point of contact for participants of the Loop in
                      case of questions, complaints or suggestions;
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  conduct applicable to them as described in the Terms of Use
                  and any rules agreed to by the participants of the Loop;
                </li>
                <li>

                  Loop; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  regularly checking if the quality of the clothes is good
                  enough to exchange them.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              As Host, you will also be the point of contact between the Loop
              and us.
