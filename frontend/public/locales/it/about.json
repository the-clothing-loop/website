  "p1": "<p><strong>The Clothing Loop è un'iniziativa che offre alle persone un modo semplice per scambiare vestiti con altri nel proprio quartiere.</strong> È divertente, gratuito e sostenibile! L'idea è semplice: (grandi) borse piene di vestiti viaggiano lungo un percorso che tocca tutti i partecipanti in una determinata città o quartiere.</p><p>Hai ricevuto la borsa dalla persona prima di te nel Loop? Ora è il momento dello shopping! Prendi tutti i capi che ti piacciono, e metti nella borsa capi di abbigliamento che siano in buone condizioni e pronti per un nuovo proprietario. Sentiti libero di condividere una foto della tua ultima scoperta nel canale di comunicazione corrispondente. <strong>È davvero bello vedere dove vanno a finire i vestiti!</strong> Porta poi la borsa alla persona successiva nell'elenco. Non tutti i partecipanti si conoscono, quindi aumenta veramente il senso di comunità nel quartiere.</p>",

  "p2": "<p>This idea originated in Amsterdam during the first lockdown. <strong>It worked so well that soon other cities followed, and it snowballed throughout the Netherlands, and even across borders.</strong> By now there are hundreds of Loops. And not just in densely populated areas, the system works everywhere! With our guidance, support and community building efforts, this local initiative grew into the powerful movement it is today. <strong>Together we have saved thousands of kilos of clothing, neighbors have gotten to know each other, and we brought about a real change in behavior with regard to our textile consumption.</strong></p><p>Please join the movement! After all, if you buy only six items less than you normally would in a year, you save about <strong>40 kilos of CO2 emissions:</strong> the equivalent of driving one gasoline car from Amsterdam to Paris. Our goal is to reach 1 million swappers within the next 5 years. <strong>This saves as much CO2 emissions as driving that same car around the world 5,000 times.</strong> You are welcome to try it now: sign up and/or follow us on socials to decide later. We’d love to inspire you to stop shopping and start swapping! PS: Why do we use Ikea bags you ask? Because we first want to use stuff that already exists. And who hasn’t got an Ikea bag lying around the house? (By the way: any large shopper will do!)</p>",
